        <tr><th>Health Effects</th></tr>
        <tr><th>Routes of Exposure</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Sarin can be disseminated in the air as an aerosol or vapor. People can be exposed by this method through inhalation, skin contact, or eye contact. Sarin can also contaminate food or water. People can be exposed by touching, or drinking contaminated food or water. Sarin vapor is heavier than air and will sink into low lying areas. (Sarin (GB): Nerve agent)</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Toxicity</th></tr>
        <tr><th>LCT50</th></tr>
        <tr><td>The table below shows the results of a study to re-assess the toxicity estimates for Sarin. In addition to the proposed changes in the numbers it also highlights the LCt50 level, it also shows the levels at which initial, mild, and severe effects take place.</td></tr>
        <!-- THE TABLE FROM TASKALINES-->
        <tr><th>Function</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Sarin functions by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The subsequent buildup of acetylcholine at nerve junctions is responsible for the symptoms caused by Sarin exposure.</td></tr>
        
        <tr><th>Short Term Effects</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Initial symptoms to exposure include a runny nose, tightness in chest, and constriction of the pupils. These symptoms are followed by nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, confusion, urination, defecation, and involuntary muscle spasms. These are caused by how the Sarin disrupts the nervous system. The cumulative effects of Sarin can be divided into three categories: muscarinic, nicotinic, and central. (Gussow)</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Muscarinic Effects</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Muscarinic effects involve the automation of glands and involuntary muscles. Specifically those in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Sarin causes increased output of glands and increases constriction of the muscles. The symptoms caused by these effects are most often the cause of death. An acronym for these effects is SLUGBAM (Gussow).</td></tr>
        <!-- THE TABLE FROM TASKALINES-->
        <tr><th>Nicotinic Effects</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Nicotinic effects involve the voluntary skeletal muscles. Sarin exposure causes twitching followed by paralysis. Additionally Nicotinic Effects involve Tachycardia (Gussow).</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Central Effects</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Central effects involve how Sarin affects the central nervous system. Symptoms often involve loss of consciousness, seizures, and brain damage (Gussow).</td></tr>

        <tr><th>Long Term Effects</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Those who survive exposure to Sarin often exhibit lasting neurological and physical effects. These long term effects are the cause of  “Gulf War Syndrome” as U.S. troops were exposed to Sarin in the conflict. Long term effects include muscle aches, joint pain, dizziness, memory lapses, headaches, fatigue and insomnia. These effects are caused by permanent damage to the nervous system following exposure, and can sometimes manifest some time after initial exposure. (Systematic review of long-term neurological effects following acute ...).</td></tr>

        <tr><th>Treatment</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Treatment varies by exposure type, and the individual symptoms the exposed display, but there are general guidelines. In an initial exposure scenario the first step is to remove the exposed from the area, and remove their clothes as they can collect the Sarin vapor and continue to seep into the skin. Additionally, the hair and skin should be decontaminated. After removing the victim from exposure the next step is to administer an antidote if possible to stop the Sarin from continuing to act. Finally, the victim should be monitored and treated for their symptoms, such as seizure medications if they have seizures, or removing any built up fluids (Sarin (GB): Nerve agent).</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>On the date of March 20, 1995, between 0700 and 0800 a group known as Aum Shinrikyo committed and act of terrorism by releasing sarin gas in the Tokyo Metro during a heavily trafficked time resulting in the deaths of fourteen and injuring one thousand fifty individuals using the subway at the time. The same group previously carried out assassinations also using sarin gas, one such event being named the Matsumoto sarin attack it occurred on June 27, 1994, nine months before the Tokyo attack it resulted in the death of eight and the injury of five hundred additional persons.</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>Aum Shinrikyo means “Supreme Truth” in Japanese, it was founded in 1987 syncretic religion that steals from many other religions for its own doctrine. The Organization is classified as a terrorist organization by: Russia, Canada, Japan, and the EU. The Cult believes that the world would end but that they would be saved. They justified their terror attacks with the idea that the world needed to be cleansed to save people from bad karma. </td></tr>
                    <tr><th id="tokyo_production_id">Production of the Sarin</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>A cult member who studied chemistry previously established a lab and researched how to make chemical weapons after being directed to do so as a senior member of the cult. He used the procedures of the five step DHMP process by IG Farben from 1938. In 1993 the cult finished making a facility large enough to produce the amounts they needed with a facility that could make approximately forty to fifty liters per batch. Before the facility was shut down it managed to produce three kilograms of sarin. When this was used up after three assassination attempts the cult produced lower quality sarin gas because they lacked normal precursors due to the destruction of chemicals in the process. This lower quality gas was brown due to impurity. They produced thirty kilograms of this lower quality brown sarin gas to be used for the Tokyo subway attack.</td></tr>
                    <tr><th id="tokyo_attack_id">The Attack</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>The attack was carried out by five members of the cult. The sarin had been decanted into plastic bags each containing just slightly less than a liter of liquid sarin each of the five individuals except one had two bags, but one had three with a total amount of nine point nine liters of sarin total used for the attack. Sarin has a LD50 of 550 micrograms per kilogram. The cultists entered the trains discreetly after which they dropped the bags and stealthily punctured them with umbrellas so the liquid sarin began to evaporate at a fast pace. Sarin is an extremely volatile substance; it evaporates and disperses relatively quickly. This led to the deaths of thirteen and injury of over a thousand.</td></tr>
                    <tr><th id="tokyo_injured_id">The Injured</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>The Hospital that served the most patients in relation to the attack was St. Luke’s hospital in Tokyo treating six hundred and forty of the total thousand victims. 107 of the moderate cases and all of the severe cases suffered from low Plasma Cholinesterase (PCE) levels. Low levels of PCE “may exhibit a prolonged paralytic response to the muscle relaxants succinylcholine and mivacurium”. Many victims were put mechanical ventilation machines to help disperse the gas. </td></tr>

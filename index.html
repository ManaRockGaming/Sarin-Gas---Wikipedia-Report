                <p>Developed in 1938 by German scientistis Gerhard Schrader as a possible pesticide. A year later Schrader was ordered to see the viability of Sarin gas as a weapon. A colourless and odurless liquid, sarin was an effective nerve agent and could be deadly at low concentrations. While the Germans where able to make a facility with the ability to make the gas, it would never be employed in World War Two. April 1997 the use of sarin gas as a weapon would be outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, and classified as a Schedule 1 substance. The most recent uses of Sarin Gas as a weapon has was in Syria, during the Syrian Civil War in 2013.

Additionally, the hair and skin should be decontaminated. After removing the victim from exposure the next step is to administer an antidote if possible to stop the Sarin from continuing to act. Finally, the victim should be monitored and treated for their symptoms, such as seizure medications if they have seizures, or removing any built up fluids (Sarin (GB): Nerve agent).</td></tr>

In 1993 the cult finished making a facility large enough to produce the amounts they needed with a facility that could make approximately forty to fifty liters per batch. Before the facility was shut down it managed to produce three kilograms of sarin. When this was used up after three assassination attempts the cult produced lower quality sarin gas because they lacked normal precursors due to the destruction of chemicals in the process. This lower quality gas was brown due to impurity. They produced thirty kilograms of this lower quality brown sarin gas to be used for the Tokyo subway attack.</td></tr>

Sarin has a LD50 of 550 micrograms per kilogram. The cultists entered the trains discreetly after which they dropped the bags and stealthily punctured them with umbrellas so the liquid sarin began to evaporate at a fast pace. Sarin is an extremely volatile substance; it evaporates and disperses relatively quickly.

                <p>
                    On March 20th 1995, members of the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cult used sarin gas in an act of domestic terrorism on Japanese citizens taking the Tokyo subway that day. The attack resulted in the deaths of 12 people with over 5500 people injured. 3 years after the Tokyo Subway attack, medical professionals from multiple Japanese Medical Universities set out to have a comprehensive study on the chronic physical and psychiatric effects of acute sarin poisoning. 
                    Using the research results from Table 2 - Figure 4 we can see that the tapping interval for the dominant hand was larger for the high exposed group compared to the control group. The finger vibration perception test showed little relationship between being exposed or not on the results. Table 3 - Figure 5 shows that members of the high exposed group had worse memories then the control group. By looking at the researcher’s conclusion, and the presented data, we can conclude that the researcher’s beliefs about the negative effects of sarin gas on motor and memory performance were correct. This conclusion may be of concern, especially since it only took 3 years from the creation of the death cult’s private laboratory to the sarin attacks to take place.
